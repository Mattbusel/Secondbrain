Microservices architecture is a software design approach where an application is broken down into smaller, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others through well-defined APIs.

This approach 1 offers several advantages: Â 


- **Scalability:** Services can be scaled individually based on demand, optimizing resource utilization.
- **Flexibility:** Teams can work independently on different services, accelerating development and deployment.
- **Resilience:** If one service fails, it doesn't necessarily bring down the entire application.
- **Technology Agnosticism:** Different services can use different technologies and programming languages.

However, microservices also introduce complexities like distributed systems management, increased operational overhead, and potential challenges in data consistency.

Overall, microservices are well-suited for large, complex applications that require high scalability, flexibility, and resilience.

Here's a list of common machine learning terms and their definitions:

### Fundamental Concepts

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A field of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.  
    
- **Supervised Learning:** A type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** A type of machine learning where a model is trained on unlabeled data.  
    
- **Reinforcement Learning:** A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.  
    

### Key Algorithms and Techniques

- **Linear Regression:** A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression:** A statistical method used to predict a binary outcome (e.g., 0 or 1).  
    
- **Decision Trees:** A tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.  
    
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis.  
    
- **Neural Networks:** A network of interconnected nodes that processes information.
- **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** A type of deep learning model used for image and video recognition.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** A type of deep learning model used for sequential data, such as time series and natural language.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** A type of deep learning model that consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator.

### Important Terms

- **Feature Engineering:** The process of selecting and transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.  
    
- **Overfitting:** A modeling error where a statistical model is too closely fit to a limited set of data points.
- **Underfitting:** A modeling error where an algorithm cannot capture the underlying trend of the data.
- **Model Evaluation:** The process of assessing the performance of a machine learning model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The process of optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve its performance.

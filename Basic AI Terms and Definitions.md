Here are some fundamental terms in the field of Artificial Intelligence:

### Core Concepts

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The science of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that involves training algorithms on data to make predictions or decisions.
- **Deep Learning:** A subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns.

### Key AI Techniques

- **Neural Networks:** A network of interconnected nodes that processes information.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- **Computer Vision:** The ability of computers to 1 interpret and understand visual information from the world. Â 

    
- **Expert Systems:** Computer systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.

### Other Important Terms

- **Algorithm:** A set of rules or instructions that a computer follows to solve a problem.
- **Model:** A mathematical representation of a real-world system.
- **Training Data:** The data used to train a machine learning model.
- **Test Data:** Data used to evaluate the performance of a trained model.
- **Overfitting:** A model that performs too well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.
- **Underfitting:** A model that fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
- **Bias:** A systematic error in a model that arises from unfair or incomplete training data.
- **Variance:** The variability of a model's predictions on different training sets.
